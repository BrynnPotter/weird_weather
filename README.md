This project is inspired for many reasons, but mainly by the desire to learn how to code. 
Within this project my goal is to learn about more than just the raw coding, this project serves as a sandbox for me to explore programming concepts, best practices for GitHub workflows, and security considerations in software development.(we learn by doing)
With this project, my goals are to not only create functional code but also a strong foundation in:
Effective use of Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration
Following security best practices in code and repository management
Continual development of the project as I learn new techniques(feel free to drop a message with any advice or words of wisdom, I appreciate you reading this far)
